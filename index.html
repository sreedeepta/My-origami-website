                <h1><u>Intresting Facts About Camel</u></br>
                <h3> Camels are social animals who roam the deserts in search of food and water with up to 30 other individuals.</br>
                </br>
                    Camels’ ears are small and hairy. However their sense of hearing is also extremely strong.</br>
                </br>
                The amount of water a camel drinks on a day-to-day basis can vary greatly, as they drink to replace only the fluid they’ve lost. A thirsty camel can drink up to 135 liters in one sitting!

                    <h3>Chameleons have eyes in the backs of their heads</br>
                    </br>
                    Special color pigment cells under the skin called chromatophores allow some chameleon species to change their skin color, creating combined patterns of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, yellow and purple.</br>
                    </br>
                    The chameleons' eyes can rotate and focus separately on 180-degree arcs, so they can see two different objects at the same time. This gives them a full 360-degree field of vision.
